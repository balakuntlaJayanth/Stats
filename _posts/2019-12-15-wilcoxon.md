## Wilcoxon signed-rank test


Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the non-parametric test which is an alternative to the t-test. It is used to compare the differences between the 2 groups when data does not follow Normal distribution.

Test can be applied to any dataset irrespective of there distribution when there exists a continuous dependent variable.

wilcoxon signed test was used to test significant difference between the 2 conditions such as before and after treatment or intervention.

The two samples need to be dependent observations of the cases.The Wilcoxon signed rank test ranks the differences based on the value of the difference between the 2 groups and is therefore a non-parametric test.



### Assumptions of  Wilcoxon signed-rank test

- Data does not follow Normal Distribution . Prefered distribution is binomial distribution. 

	Note:  If data follows normal distribution and there exists a    continous dependent variable test can be applied 
	
	
- Two dependent samples considered for analysiss follows identical distribution.
- The Wilcoxon sign test assess for differences between the 2 conditions for example before treatment and after treatment with specific intervention .
- The samples used in the analysis are randomly and independently drawn of each other.
- Samples considered for comparison requires a continuous dependent variable.
- The scale of the 2 samples should be ordinal in nature.

### Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis is that the median difference between pairs of observations is zero. There is no significant difference between the medians of the samples. 

Note : In ttest null hypothesis is that the mean difference between pairs is zero. 

### Alternate Hypothesis

There is significant difference between the 2 groups.


### Source of the data.

Python implementation of Wilcoxon signed rank test


```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
df1 = pd.read_csv('blood_pressure.csv')
df1.head()
```

The data is suitable for wilcoxon signed rank test because there exists a continous variable called age group(agegrp). 


```python
df1.describe()
```

The age group(agegrp) variable represents the continous variable. Data has 2 groups blood pressure before treatment(bp_before) and blood pressure after treatment(bp_after).


```python
from scipy import stats
```


```python
df1['bp_difference'] = df1['bp_before'] - df1['bp_after']
df1['bp_difference'][df1['bp_difference']==0]
```




    41     0
    74     0
    103    0
    115    0
    Name: bp_difference, dtype: int64



The one of the important parameter to consider in wilcoxon signed rank test is difference of zero between 2 conditions. There a 4 observations in which the difference between 2 conditions is zero. observations with zero will be automatically excluded from the analysis.

In this blog we use scipy.stats.wilcoxon() method to conduct wilcoxon test.

### scipy stats wilcoxon() method

```python
stats.wilcoxon(df1['bp_before'], df1['bp_after'])
```




    WilcoxonResult(statistic=2234.5, pvalue=0.0014107333565442858)

### pingouin wilcoxon method


```python
pg.wilcoxon(df1['bp_before'], df1['bp_after'], tail='two-sided')
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>W-val</th>
      <th>tail</th>
      <th>p-val</th>
      <th>RBC</th>
      <th>CLES</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Wilcoxon</th>
      <td>2234.5</td>
      <td>two-sided</td>
      <td>0.001417</td>
      <td>0.341</td>
      <td>0.604</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


The pvalue is less than 0.05 which indicates statistical significance.  Therefore reject the null hypothesis in support of the alternative.

RBC provided by the pingouin represents Rank biserial correlation calculated from rank biserial test.

Higher RBC coefficients denote a stronger magnitude of relationship between variables. Smaller RBC coefficients denote weaker relationships. 

Positive RBC correlations denote a relationship that travels at the same trajectory. As one value goes up, then the other value goes up. Also, as one value goes down, then the other value goes down too.

Negative RBC correlations denote a relationship that travels in different directions. As one value goes up, the other value goes down. Also, as one value goes down, then the other value goes up.
